                        are developing new medical technologies to help doctors with the treatment of diseases. These include miniature imaging devices to guide surgery, artificial intelligence or ‘AI’ for diagnosis and robotics to assist surgeons.

                        is developing small imaging probes that will be tested and applied in various surgical areas, with a particular focus on heart procedures. The probes use light and sound to navigate blood vessels in the heart and find obstructions or ‘plaque’, which narrow the blood vessels and lead to health problems like heart disease. Once located by the probe, doctors can remove the plaque or use a ‘stent’ (a tiny wire mesh tube, which is expanded like a balloon) to open up the blood vessel and increase blood flow.

                    Dr. Colchester’s research involves developing new imaging and sensing technologies to transform how minimally invasive surgeries are performed. He uses sound, light, heat and more in his research to provide information about the human body and how to treat diseases. The Research Group works across disciplines, combining chemistry, physics, maths, computer science, engineering, and medicine to make solutions. Most importantly, they work closely with doctors and patients to make sure everything has a purpose.
