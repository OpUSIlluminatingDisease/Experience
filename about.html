                        are developing new medical technologies to help doctors with the treatment of diseases. These include miniature imaging devices to guide surgery, artificial intelligence or ‘AI’ for diagnosis and robotics to assist surgeons.

                        is developing small imaging probes that will be tested and applied in various surgical areas, with a particular focus on heart procedures. The probes use light and sound to navigate blood vessels in the heart and find abnormalities and obstructions or ‘plaque’, which narrow the blood vessels and lead to health problems like heart disease. Once located by the probe, doctors can remove the plaque or use a ‘stent’ (a tiny wire mesh tube, which is expanded like a balloon) to open up the blood vessel and increase blood flow.
