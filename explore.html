                <br>
                <br>

                Another strand of OpUS is the 
                
                <a href = "https://artspaces.kunstmatrix.com/en/exhibition/6917981/surge" target="_blank">creative exchange.</a>

                We aimed to connect members of the public with scientists and doctors working on the latest medical technologies at WEISS and 
                <a href = "https://www.ucl.ac.uk/">UCL</a> to build a deeper understanding between the two groups. In the context of the global pandemic, however, in-person activities posed a challenge, so we decided to explore virtual tools and spaces.
                
                <br>
                <br>

                In the first stage, we wanted to amplify the voices of those who are likely to be most affected by the new medical technologies, either directly or indirectly. These technologies will be tested and applied in various surgical areas, with a particular focus on heart procedures in Dr Colchester’s 
                
                <a href = "https://www.interventionaldevices.org/">Research Group.</a>

                Therefore, we invited heart patients and their families, as well as individuals at risk of heart disease, to complete a short survey of questions from scientists about the new medical technologies. We also approached young people (age 16-18), as they are on the verge of choosing a career path and can offer unique perspectives in upcoming research. 
                
                <br>
                <br>

                Participants were encouraged to ask questions, and share their experiences, views, ideas and concerns. 
                
                <br>
                <br>

                We had an overwhelming 140+ responses and questions from the survey participants were grouped into themes. In the second stage of the exchange, we approached scientists and doctors from WEISS and the UCL Institute of Healthcare Engineering to respond to the questions for a series of bitesize videos. The twist - we asked them to respond using a creative medium or method that they are not familiar with. We hoped this exercise would encourage them to view their research and work from a different lens, explore the creative process and most importantly, have fun with it!
                
                <br>
                <br>

                We want to thank everyone who took part in the creative exchange and hope to expand it in the future, with the aim of shaping a more inclusive, interconnected research and healthcare landscape.
